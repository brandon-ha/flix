### Notes
Working with collections for the first time was rather confusing because of the weird automatic image resizing Swift defaults to. Either way, I learned a lot about navigation and collection view controllers.

### Notes
I found that conencting the storyboard elements with the Swift files a little confusing at first because connections between the two still remain unless explicitly deleted from both the storyboard and the Swift files.
