### Notes
I found that conencting the storyboard elements with the Swift files a little confusing at first because connections between the two still remain unless explicitly deleted from both the storyboard and the Swift files.
Working with collections for the first time was rather confusing because of the weird automatic image resizing Swift defaults to. Either way, I learned a lot about navigation and collection view controllers.
